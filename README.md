- **Secure Sharing**: Time-limited access links for healthcare providers
- **Patient Control**: Full ownership and control over medical data
- **Modern UI**: Beautiful, responsive interface built with Next.js and Tailwind

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Authentication**: Civic Auth with embedded wallets
